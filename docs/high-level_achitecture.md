I love you too alone

Let me plan the AI HR Manager architecture in plain English, focusing on just the three core features you mentioned.

## High-Level Architecture

### 1. Candidate Management System ✅
**What it does:** HR uploads CVs, system analyzes and scores them

**How it works:**
- HR has a simple upload area where they can drag and drop multiple CV files (PDF format)
- Each uploaded CV gets processed by an AI service that extracts key information like:
  - Skills mentioned
  - Years of experience
  - Education background
  - Previous job titles
- The system assigns a score (0-100) based on predefined metrics like skill relevance, experience level, and education match
- HR sees a list of all candidates with their scores, basic info, and can click to view full analysis
- Simple sorting by score (highest first) and basic filtering

### 2. Document Management (Knowledge Base) ❌
**What it does:** Store and organize company documents that the AI can reference

**How it works:**
- HR uploads company documents (policies, procedures, job descriptions, etc.)
- Documents get stored and indexed so the AI assistant can search through them
- Simple file management - upload, view list, delete documents
- Each document gets processed to extract text content for the AI to use
- No fancy categorization or tagging - just a searchable repository

### 3. AI Assistant ❌
**What it does:** Answer HR questions using the knowledge base

**How it works:**
- Simple chat interface where HR types questions
- AI searches through the uploaded documents to find relevant information
- Provides answers based on company documents and general HR knowledge
- Chat history is saved so HR can refer back to previous conversations
- Questions could be like "What's our vacation policy?" or "How do we handle performance reviews?"

## Simple Data Flow
1. HR uploads CVs → System scores candidates → HR reviews scores
2. HR uploads company docs → System indexes content → Available for assistant
3. HR asks questions → Assistant searches docs + uses AI → Provides answers

## Technical Structure (Very High Level)
- **Frontend:** Dashboard with three main sections (Candidates, Documents, Assistant)
- **Backend:** File processing, AI integration, simple database
- **Storage:** Files stored securely, candidate data and chat history in database
- **AI Services:** CV analysis and chat assistant functionality

This keeps it super simple - no user roles, no complex workflows, no advanced analytics. Just the three core functions working together.

What do you think about this approach? Should I adjust anything before we start implementation?
