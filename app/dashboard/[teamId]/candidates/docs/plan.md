# Candidate Management Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the complete workflow for implementing the candidate management system, supporting both manual CV upload and automated email processing.

## Workflow Options

### Option A: Manual Upload (Original Plan)
1. HR uploads multiple CV files (PDF format)
2. System processes each CV with Gemini AI
3. AI extracts structured candidate data
4. Data is saved to Firebase
5. HR reviews candidates and updates their status

### Option B: Automated Email Processing (NEW! ðŸš€)
1. n8n monitors HR Gmail inbox for job applications
2. Automatically detects emails with CV attachments
3. Sends PDF to AI analysis API
4. Creates candidate records automatically
5. Notifies HR of new processed candidates
6. HR reviews and manages candidates in dashboard

## Current Implementation Phases (Option A)

## Phase 1: File Upload & PDF Processing System

### 1.1 Create CV Upload Page
- **File**: `app/dashboard/[teamId]/candidates/upload/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Drag & drop interface for multiple PDF files
  - File validation (PDF only, max size limits)
  - Upload progress indicators
  - Preview of selected files before upload
  - Real-time PDF parsing feedback

### 1.2 PDF Processing Setup
- **PDF to Markdown Conversion**:
  - Use `pdf-parse` library to extract text from PDFs
  - Convert extracted text to clean markdown format
  - Preserve formatting (headers, lists, sections)
  - Handle multi-page documents properly

### 1.3 Upload & Processing API Endpoint
- **File**: `app/api/candidates/upload/route.ts`
- **Functionality**:
  - Accept multiple PDF files (client-side only)
  - Parse each PDF to extract text content
  - Convert text to structured markdown
  - Store markdown content in Firestore
  - Return parsed content and metadata
  - Handle parsing errors gracefully

### 1.4 Database Schema for PDF Content
```typescript
interface CandidateDocument {
  id: string;
  teamId: string;
  fileName: string;
  fileSize: number;
  uploadedAt: Date;
  markdownContent: string; // Parsed PDF content as markdown
  processingStatus: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  processingError?: string;
}
```

## Phase 2: AI Processing with Gemini

### 2.1 Gemini Integration Setup
- **File**: `lib/services/gemini-service.ts`
- **Configuration**:
  - Set up Gemini API client
  - Configure API key and settings
  - Create prompt templates for CV analysis

### 2.2 CV Text Extraction
- **Options**:
  - Use PDF parsing library (pdf-parse or similar)
  - Or send PDF directly to Gemini Vision API
- **Process**:
  - Extract text content from PDF
  - Clean and format text for AI processing

### 2.3 AI Analysis Prompt Design
```json
{
  "prompt": "Analyze this CV and extract structured information. Return JSON with:",
  "required_fields": {
    "name": "string",
    "email": "string", 
    "phone": "string",
    "position": "string (inferred job title)",
    "experience": "number (years)",
    "skills": "array of strings",
    "education": "array of objects",
    "workExperience": "array of objects",
    "summary": "string (brief summary)",
    "aiAnalysis": {
      "skillsMatch": "number (0-100)",
      "experienceLevel": "Junior|Mid-level|Senior|Expert",
      "strengths": "array of strings",
      "weaknesses": "array of strings", 
      "recommendation": "string",
      "keyHighlights": "array of strings"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2.4 AI Processing API
- **File**: `app/api/candidates/analyze/route.ts`
- **Process**:
  1. Receive CV file URL
  2. Extract text from PDF
  3. Send to Gemini with structured prompt
  4. Parse and validate AI response
  5. Calculate overall score (0-100)
  6. Return structured candidate data

  email: string,
  phone?: string,
  position: string,
  experience: number,
  score: number,
  status: 'new' | 'reviewed' | 'shortlisted' | 'rejected',
  uploadedAt: Timestamp,
  cvUrl: string,
  skills: string[],
  education: Education[],
  workExperience: WorkExperience[],
  summary: string,
  aiAnalysis: AIAnalysis,
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

### 3.2 Database Service
- **File**: `lib/services/candidate-service.ts`
- **Functions**:
  - `createCandidate(data: Candidate): Promise<string>`
  - `getCandidates(teamId: string): Promise<Candidate[]>`
  - `updateCandidateStatus(id: string, status: string): Promise<void>`
  - `getCandidateById(id: string): Promise<Candidate>`
  - `deleteCanddidate(id: string): Promise<void>`

### 3.3 Firebase Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /candidates/{candidateId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && resource.data.teamId in request.auth.token.teams;
    }
  }
}
```
